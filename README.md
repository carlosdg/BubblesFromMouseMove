# TS_BubblesFromMouse
<h2> Brief description: </h2>
<p>
    This is a simple script to get familiar with TypeScript. When you move your mouse over
    the canvas (or touch the screen) little bubbles will appear on the mouse position
    and will move randomly giving a shaking effect. Up to 50 bubbles can be created, after
    that number the oldest one will be removed. The idea of this project came from the YouTube
    channel "The Coding Train" that has videos teaching some JavaScript features with this idea.
